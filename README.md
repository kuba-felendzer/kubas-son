# DISCLAIMER:

This bot was made by myself for use solely in a Discord server I use with my friends. As such, this is not my best work, nor is it a particularly family-friendly bot.
He is made to be an offensive, dumb, stupid "person", so take what you see here knowing that.
This is *not* meant to be a reflection of who I am! All the features made for this bot were suggested by the Discord server, and as such some rowdy and uncouth commands were added.

# USAGE

If, for some reason, you want to download this code, you will need a few things:
`Python 3.5 or above`: *https://python.org* (Manjaro/Arch: `sudo pacman -S python`)
`Discord.py`: `pip install discord`
